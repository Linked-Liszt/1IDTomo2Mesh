# 1IDTomo2Mesh
Tomo2Mesh API for Beamline 1ID.

# Installation

(Currently Notes):
- Requires cupy + Tensorflow + CUDA to play nicely
  - TODO: Figure out how to guarantee conda install handles both
- Pymesh - no pypi: https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
  - Requires system permissions. Not easily done through conda.
